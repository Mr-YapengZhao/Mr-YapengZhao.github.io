[A Low-Overhead Incorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI Feedback Framework for Massive MIMO Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10600118)

**Binggui Zhou**, Xi Yang, Jintao Wang, Shaodan Ma, Feifei Gao, and Guanghua Yang
 
[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04062) \| <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='2RwBacMAAAAJ:3s1wT3WcHBgC'></span></strong>

- In this work, we propose the **Incorporation-Extrapolation based Few-Shot CSI feedback Framework (IEFSF)** for massive MIMO systems to enable low-overhead CSI feedback with reduced data collection cost. An incorporation-extrapolation scheme for eigenvector-based CSI feedback is proposed to reduce the feedback overhead. Then, to alleviate the necessity of extensive collected samples and enable few-shot CSI feedback, we further propose a **knowledge-driven data augmentation (KDDA) method** and an **artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) -based data augmentation method** by exploiting the domain knowledge of wireless channels and by exploiting a novel generative model, respectively.
- Experimental results based on the DeepMIMO dataset demonstrate that the proposed IEFSF significantly reduces CSI feedback overhead by **64 times** compared with existing methods while maintaining higher feedback accuracy using **only several hundred collected samples**.

[Pay Less But Get More: A Dual-Attention-based Channel Estimation Network for Massive MIMO Systems with Low-Density Pilots](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315065)

**Binggui Zhou**, Xi Yang, Shaodan Ma, Feifei Gao, and Guanghua Yang
 
[Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00986) \| [Code](https://github.com/bgzhou/DACEN) \| <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='2RwBacMAAAAJ:D03iK_w7-QYC'></span></strong>

- In this work, we propose the **dual-attention-based channel estimation network (DACEN)** to realize accurate channel estimation via low-density pilots, by jointly learning the spatial-temporal domain features of massive MIMO channels with the temporal attention module and the spatial attention module. To further improve the estimation accuracy, we propose a **parameter-instance transfer learning approach** to transfer the channel knowledge learned from the high-density pilots pre-acquired during the training dataset collection period.
- Experimental results reveal that the proposed DACEN-based method can reduce up to **92% of pilot overhead** by reducing the pilot density **from 26/52 to 2/52** than traditional channel estimation methods. Additionally, with the proposed parameter-instance transfer learning approach, the DACEN-based method achieves **additional performance gain**, thereby further demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.

[A Graph-Attention Based Spatial-Temporal Learning Framework for Tourism Demand Forecasting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950705123000254)

**Binggui Zhou**, Yunxuan Dong, Guanghua Yang, Fen Hou, Zheng Hu, Suxiu Xu, and Shaodan Ma
 
<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='2RwBacMAAAAJ:TFP_iSt0sucC'></span></strong>

- In this paper, we propose a graph-attention based spatial‚Äìtemporal learning framework for tourism demand forecasting. A **weight-dynamic multi-dimensional graph** is organized to embed multiple explicit dynamic spatial connections and provide a node attribute sequence for learning implicit dynamic spatial connections. We further propose a **heterogeneous spatial‚Äìtemporal graph-attention network (HSTGANet)**, which is effective in handling both explicit and implicit dynamic spatial connections, learning high-dimensional spatial‚Äìtemporal features, and forecasting tourism demand.
- Experimental results demonstrate the **effectiveness of the proposed model** over baseline models in forecasting the tourism demand for six regions of Wanshan Archipelago in Zhuhai, China, and indicate that the proposed spatial‚Äìtemporal learning framework may provide **useful insights for developing more effective models** for other spatial‚Äìtemporal forecasting problems.

[Interpretable Temporal Attention Network for COVID-19 Forecasting](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494622001545)

**Binggui Zhou**, Guanghua Yang, Zheng Shi, and Shaodan Ma
 
<strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='2RwBacMAAAAJ:TQgYirikUcIC'></span></strong>

- In this work, we propose the **Interpretable Temporal Attention Network (ITANet)** for COVID-19 forecasting and inferring the importance of government interventions. The proposed model is with an encoder‚Äìdecoder architecture and employs long short-term memory (LSTM) for temporal feature extraction and multi-head attention for long-term dependency caption. The model simultaneously takes historical information, a priori known future information, and pseudo future information into consideration, where the pseudo future information is learned with the **covariate forecasting network (CFN)** and **multi-task learning (MTL)**. In addition, we also propose the **degraded teacher forcing (DTF) method** to train the model efficiently. 
- Compared with other models, the ITANet is more effective in the forecasting of COVID-19 new confirmed cases.
- The importance of government interventions against COVID-19 is further inferred by the **Temporal Covariate Interpreter (TCI)** of the model.

### 1. Knowledge-and-Data Driven Intelligent Wireless Communications

<img src='images/Knowledge-and-Data_Driven_Intelligent_Wireless_Communications.png' width = "1200" alt="" align=center />

Currently, mobile communications have evolved into 5G/B5G and we are now anticipating what 6G will be like. According to [1], the usage scenarios of IMT-2030 (6G) include immersive communication, hyper reliable and low-latency communication, massive communication, ubiquitous connectivity, integrated sensing and communication, etc. These usage scenarios raise **high data rate requirements**, **hyper reliability requirements**, and **massive connection requirements** to current wireless communication systems. To meet these requirements, extreme/massive MIMO has been recognized as an essential technology to provide spatial degrees of freedom, diversity or multiplexing gain, and array gain, thereby improving the spectral and energy efficiencies of wireless communication systems.

However, massive MIMO also brings out **complicated channel characteristics** and **high overhead and computational complexity**, which are significantly challenging. It is fortunate that by learning from extensive data, some deep learning-based algorithms have been proposed to capture the complicated channel characteristics of massive MIMO channels and further improve the spectral and energy efficiencies of massive MIMO systems. Nonetheless, the high overhead and computational complexity of massive MIMO systems are not significantly reduced by existing deep learning-based algorithms. In addition, most existing deep learning-based algorithms are purely data-driven and basically rely on extensive collected data for learning the features of complicated wireless channels, leading to unaffordable data collection costs.

To simultaneously improve spectral and energy efficiencies, reduce overhead and computational complexity, and circumvent extensive data collection towards intelligent wireless communications, we investigate how to realize knowledge-and-data driven intelligent wireless communications, particularly for massive MIMO systems. Both **domain knowledge**, e.g., multi-domain correlations and channel sparsity, and **data,** e.g., historical data and cross-domain data, are exploited for framework design, learning paradigm design, and computationally efficient design to achieve the aforementioned goals.

Channel modeling is an important area of 6G pre-research. To cope with the increasingly complex wireless communication environment and make full use of data-driven/knowledge-and-data driven algorithms for complex channel modeling, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) for channel modeling and constructing an extensive wireless channel dataset of high-quality samples using a small number of real channel samples. The proposed GAN is based on the multi-head self-attention mechanism and convolution operations. We decouple the channel generation problem into two parts: valid (meaningful) delayed **path position generation** and valid (meaningful) delayed **path generation**. Therefore, the generator contains two sub-networks. The path generation sub-network mainly exploits Transformer layers as the backbone, while the backbone of the path position generation sub-network is with a two-layer multi-layer perceptron structure. The discriminator exploits multiple convolutional downsampling modules to distinguish between generated samples and real samples.

Deep learning based CSI feedback has received widespread attention from academia and industry in recent years. However, most of the existing deep learning based CSI feedback methods are purely data-driven. In addition to obtaining high-performance gains brought by data-driven, such methods also show poor generalization performance in different scenarios. Currently, to mitigate this issue, expensive data collection costs and long training time for different scenarios are inevitable, and thus poses further challenges for the implementation of such deep learning based CSI feedback methods. To address these challenges, we propose a CSI feedback method that uses only a small number of samples to obtain better generalization capabilities. Through **frequency domain data augmentation** and the advanced **dual-attention-based CSI feedback model**, the proposed CSI feedback method can achieve CSI feedback with good generalization ability in a very concise way. In addition, to mitigate quantization errors, we further propose a **quantization ensemble framework** which exploits several quantizers and dequantizers for ensemble. Specifically, constrained by 30-bit CSI feedback overhead and to balance the number of feedback bits, quantization error and the size of backbone networks, we use 27 bits for quantization and 3 bits as the quantizer index (which indicates that a total of 8 quantizers with different configurations can be utilized). Hybrid scalar quantization is considered, and each two quantizers share an Encoder backbone network to ensure that each Encoder backbone network has larger model scale and learning capabilities.
