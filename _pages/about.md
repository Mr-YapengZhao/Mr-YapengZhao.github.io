# üîé Research

## üî• It has been visioned for years and gradually reached a consensus that the upcoming sixth-generation (6G) network will be a multi-functional network which aims to integrate communication, sensing, computing, and intelligence. Such integration can act as the powerful engine for realizing the intelligent world of the future.

## Research Interests

<div class="begin-examples"></div>
**(1) Integrated communication and computation (ICC)**: over-the-air computation (AirComp), federated learning (FL), mobile edge computing (MEC).
The main purpose of AirComp is to merge the concurrently transmitted data to compute a class of so-called nomographic functions, thus realize one-shot data aggregation. AirComp seamlessly integrates the communication and computation procedures through the superposition property of multiple-access channels, which yields a revolutionary multiple-access paradigm shift from ‚Äúcompute-after-communicate‚Äù to ‚Äúcompute-when-communicate‚Äù.
